\section{Dynamics of the polar stratosphere}
\label{sec:dynam-polar-strat}


\subsection{Zonal mean circulation}

Each winter the polar regions descend into a polar night and the stratosphere
cools by infrared radiation to space. This sets up a strong meridional
temperature gradient which increases the vertical zonal wind shear in accordance
with the thermal wind balance relation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u_g}{\partial z} = -\frac{R}{fH}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \,, 
\end{equation} 
where $u_g$ is the geostrophic zonal velocity,
$u_g = -f^{-1}\partial Z/\partial y$, $Z$ is geopotential height, $f$ is the
Coriolis parameter, $f=2\Omega\sin\phi$, and $R$ is the specific gas
constant. Here, a beta-plane geometry is used such that $f=f_0+\beta y$, where
$f_0=f(\phi_0)$ and $\beta = 2\Omega a^{-1}\cos\phi_0$, $a$ is the Earth's
radius and $\phi_{0}$ is a reference latitude. $H$ is the scale height given by
$H = RT_s/g$, where $T_s$ is a reference temperature and $g$ is the acceleration
due to gravity. This equation relies on hydrostatic and geostrophic
approximations but is approximately satisfied on seasonal timescales. Hence, the
meridional temperature gradient decreasing from equator to pole results in a
region of westerly winds surrounding the pole; this is known as the
stratospheric polar vortex.

Figure \ref{fig:zmzw_zmT_clim} shows zonal-mean zonal wind and temperature
averaged over the boreal winter (December-February; DJF) and austral winter
(July-August; JJA) using data from 1979-2010 from the ERA-Interim reanalysis
(details in Section \ref{sec:reanalysis-data}). In both cases the westerly
vortex in the winter hemisphere can be seen along with a local minimum in
temperature at the winter pole in the lower stratosphere. Weaker easterly winds
are present in the summer hemisphere. The maximum strength of the polar vortex
occurs at midlatitudes between 0.1-1~hPa in the mesosphere, and is stronger in
the Southern Hemisphere (SH) with a maximum of $90~\mathrm{ms^{-1}}$ than the
Northern Hemisphere (NH) with a maximum of $50~\mathrm{ms^{-1}}$. The winter
polar stratosphere is also approximately 20~K colder in th SH than the NH.

   respective winters. Data is from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1979-2009).}
 \label{fig:zmzw_NH_SH}
\end{figure}

The maximum strength of the vortex in the stratosphere occurs at approximately
$60^{\circ}$N/S with little variation through the depth of the
stratosphere. Figure \ref{fig:zmzw_NH_SH} shows the annual cycle and variability
of zonal-mean zonal wind at 10~hPa $60^{\circ}$N and $60^{\circ}$S. As well as
being weaker on average than the SH, the winter NH stratospheric polar vortex
can also be seen to be significantly more variable than the SH. There are a
number of years in the NH for which $\overline{u}$ becomes negative during the
winter, but only one such year in the SH (these events are discussed further in
Section \ref{sec:strat-sudd-warm}). A further clear feature of both NH and SH is
that variability during the summer is much less than that during winter. All
these observations are due almost entirely to the influence of wave phenomena in
the stratosphere, as described in the next section.


\subsection{Waves in the stratosphere}
\label{sec:plan-waves-strat}

\subsubsection{Planetary waves}
\label{sec:planetary-waves}

Large-scale Rossby or planetary waves\footnote{Here, as is common in the
  stratospheric literature, ``wave'' is taken to mean any deviation from the
  zonal-mean state which not necessarily a physical structure.} play a vital
role in the dynamics of the extratropical stratosphere. They mostly enter the
stratosphere from the troposphere, where they are forced, for example, by air
flow around topography, latent heat release, or nonlinear evolution of
tropospheric eddies \citep{Scinocca1998}. These large-scale waves approximately
satisfy the quasi-geostropic (QG) approximation of hydrostatically balanced
incompressible flow with low Rossby number, $\mathrm{Ro} = U/f_oL \ll 1$, where
$U$ and $L$ are characteristic velocity and length scales respectively
\citep{Andrews1987}. Under this approximation and in the absence of friction,
the following relation, known as the \emph{quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity
  equation}, holds:
\begin{equation}
D_gq_g = f_0\rho_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\frac{\rho_0Q}{\partial\theta_{0}/\partial z} \, . 
\label{eq:qgpv}
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{equation}
D_g \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + u_g\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +
v_g\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \, , 
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
  q_g = f_0 + \beta y - \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial
    y} + \rho_o^{-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial
    z}\left(\rho_of_0\frac{\theta_e}{\partial\theta_{0}/\partial z}\right) \, , 
\end{equation}
is the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity. Here, $v_g$ is the geostrophic
meridional velocity, $v_g = f^{-1}\partial Z/\partial x$, $Q$ is the diabatic
heating rate, $\rho_0$ is a reference density and $\theta_0$ is a reference
potential temperature, $\theta_0 = T_s(p_s/p)^\kappa$, where
$p_s=1000~\mathrm{hPa}$, and $\kappa = R/c_p \approx 2/7$, where $c_p$ is the
specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure. $\theta_e$ represents the
departure from $\theta_0$, and is assumed to be small in the sense that
$|\partial\theta_e/\partial z| \ll |\partial\theta_0/\partial z|$. An important
consequence of Equation \ref{eq:qgpv} is that $q_g$ is conserved following the
geostrophic wind for adiabatic flow ($Q=0$), and therefore acts as a tracer.
\footnote{Throughout most of this thesis, Ertel's potential vorticity, $q$,
  is used. This is defined by
\begin{equation*}
  q = \frac{1}{\rho}\zeta\cdot\nabla\theta \, , 
\end{equation}
where $\zeta$ is the absolute velocity. \citet{Charney1962} showed that when the
quasi-geostrophic approximation is valid
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial s}\right)_{\theta=\mathrm{const.}} \approx
\frac{1}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial \theta_0}{\partial z}\left(\frac{\partial
    q_g}{\partial s}\right)_{z=\mathrm{const.}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $s = t$, $x$ or $y$. Hence, a similar conservation law as for
$q_g$ applies to $q$, which is conserved on isentropic (e.g., constant
$\theta$) surfaces.  }

In the case of approximately zonal flow $[\overline{u}(y,z),0,0]$, Equation
\ref{eq:qgpv} can be linearised to give
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \overline{u}\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x}\right)q_g' + v'\frac{\partial\overline{q_g}}{\partial y} = f_0\rho_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\frac{\rho_0Q'}{\partial\theta_{0}/\partial z} \, ,
\label{eq:linear_qgpv} 
\end{equation}
where primes represent deviations from the zonal mean (e.g., $q_g =
\overline{q_g} + q_g'$). It can be shown that Equation \ref{eq:linear_qgpv}
supports wave-like solutions, with vertical propagation dependent upon the
condition:
\begin{equation}
0 < \overline{u}-c < \overline{u}_c \equiv \beta(k^2+l^2+\epsilon/4H^2)^{-1} \,,
\end{equation}
which is known as the \emph{Charney-Drazin criterion} after
\citet{Charney1961}. Here, $c$ is the wave's zonal phase speed, $k$ and $l$ are
the zonal and meridional wavenumbers respectively, and $\epsilon = f_0^2/N^2$,
where $N^2 = H^{-1}Re^{-\kappa z/H}\partial\theta_0/\partial z$ is the static
stability. In the case of waves whose phase is stationary with respect to the
ground ($c=0$), this simplifies to
\begin{equation}
0 < \overline{u} < \overline{u}_c\, . 
\label{eq:charney-drazin}
\end{equation}
It is therefore apparent that in order for planetary waves to propagate
vertically (such as from the troposphere to the stratosphere), a westerly flow
must be present that is not too strong. Additionally, this maximum speed is
dependent on wavenumber, such that a lower wavenumber can propagate in a
stronger westerly flow. While the assumptions here are not representative of the
real atmosphere (such as purely zonal flow, and small deviations from the zonal
mean), this criterion does capture the most important features of the relation
between zonal assymmetries and the zonal flow, and similar relations can be
found for more complex background states \citep{Andrews1987}.

An important consequence of the Charney-Drazin criterion for stratospheric flow
is that the strength of the stratospheric polar vortices shown in Figures
\ref{fig:zmzw_zmT_clim} and \ref{fig:zmzw_NH_SH} is often sufficient to exclude
all but the lowest wavenumbers (typically zonal wavenumbers 1 and 2) from
propagating upwards from the troposphere. Hence the length-scale of typical
stratospheric zonal assymmetries is much larger than that of the troposphere. 

\bigskip When planetary waves reach a \emph{critical surface}, where propagation
is prohibited (for instance, a region where $\overline{u} = c$), the above
linear analysis breaks down. In this scenario waves can ``break'', imparting
momentum onto the zonal flow. There is therefore a two-way interaction between
the zonal flow and planetary waves; a phenomenon known as \emph{wave-mean flow
  interaction}. Wave breaking was studied in an idealised two-dimensional model
by \citet{Stewartson1978} and \citet{Warn1978}. They found momentum to be
absorbed in a narrow \emph{critical layer} close to the critical surface, with
potential vorticity (PV) contours being irreversibly stretched and mixed in
increasingly fine scales; a process known as a `potential enstrophy cascade'
\citep[e.g.,][]{Rhines1979}. They also showed that the critical layer is
initially absorbing, but becomes a reflecting surface after some time. Time
varying results from a version of the Stewartson-Warn-Warn model from
\citet{Andrews1987} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:cats_eyes}. Similar wave
breaking behaviour was first observed in the real stratosphere by
\citet{McIntyre1983} using isentropic maps of potential vorticity, including the
irreversible deformation of PV contours shown in Figure \ref{fig:cats_eyes}.

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/chapter-intro/breaking_wave_AHL.png}
 \caption[Results from a Stewartson-Warn-Warn model of wave
 breaking.]{Stewartson-Warn-Warn time-dependent analytical solution of a Rossby
   wave nonlinear critical layer (time advancing in even steps from
   (a)-(b)-(c)). The flow is periodic in $x$ and the $y$ scale is greatly
   exaggerated and the initial critical line was at $y=y_c$. The thin lines
   indicate streamlines and lens shaped regions of closed streamlines are known
   as ``Kelvin's cats' eyes''. The thick line shows the position of the absolute
   vorticity contour $\zeta=\zeta_c$, that initially lay along $y=y_c$ (in this
   barotropic model, the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity, $q_g$, reduces
   to $\zeta$). Hence, $\zeta<\zeta_c$ in the stippled region and
   $\zeta>\zeta_c$ in the unstippled region. In (a) it can be seen that $v>0$
   for most of the stippled region, indicating partial absorption, whereas in
   (b) and (c) $v\leq0$ in the stippled region indicating reflection. Figure
   from \citet{Andrews1987}.}
 \label{fig:cats_eyes}
\end{figure}

A further effect of wave breaking is the induction of a \emph{residual
  circulation}, $[0, \overline{v}^*, \overline{w}^*]$, where $\overline{v}^*$ and
$\overline{w}^*$ are the transformed Eulerian-mean (TEM) meridional and vertical
velocities given by
\begin{equation}
  \overline{v}^* = \overline{v} - \frac{1}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}
  \left(\frac{\rho_o\overline{v'\theta'}}{\partial\overline{\theta}/{\partial z}}\right) \, , 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\overline{w}^* = \overline{w} + \frac{1}{a\cos\phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}
\left(\frac{\cos\phi\overline{v'\theta'}}{\partial\overline{\theta}/{\partial
      z}}\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
which approximate the Lagrangian-mean circulation under time-averaged conditions
\citep{Andrews1976,Dunkerton1978,Holton1980a}. Under the TEM formalism, the zonal
momentum equation becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\overline{u}}{\partial t} +
\overline{v}^*\left(\frac{1}{a\cos\phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}(\overline{u}\cos{\phi})
  - f \right) + \overline{w}^*\frac{\partial\overline{u}}{\partial z} =
\frac{\mathbf{\nabla \cdot F}}{\rho_oa\cos\phi} + \overline{X}
\label{eq:zonal_momentum}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{X}$ represents frictional terms and $\mathbf{F}$ is the
Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux with components
\begin{equation}
F^\phi = \rho_0a\cos\phi\left(\frac{\partial\overline{u}}{\partial
    z}\frac{\overline{v'\theta'}}{\partial\overline{\theta}/\partial z} -
  \overline{v'u'}\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
F^z =
\rho_0a\cos\phi\left(\left[f-\frac{1}{a\cos\phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}(\overline{u}\cos\phi)\right]\frac{\overline{v'\theta'}}{\partial\theta/\partial
      z} - \overline{w'u'}\right) \, .
\end{equation}
$\mathbf{F}$ can be interpreted as the flux of wave activity
\citep{Andrews1987}, and therefore $\mathbf{\nabla\cdot F}<0$ (covergence)
represents a dissipation of wave activity, as is the case in wave breaking. It
can be seen that for a steady zonal flow ($\partial\overline{u}/\partial t = 0$)
in the absence of wave driving ($\mathbf{\nabla\cdot F} = 0$) or friction
($\overline{X} = 0$), a solution of Equation (\ref{eq:zonal_momentum}) is
$\overline{v}^*=0, \overline{w}^*=0$.  However, in the presence of these forcing
terms, a non-zero residual circulation will be induced. Climatologically, this
circulation consists of upwelling in the tropics and poleward and downward
motion in the extratropics; a pattern which forms a significant part of the
Brewer-Dobson circulation\footnote{Strictly, the Brewer-Dobson circulation
  represents the meridional transport of tracers, and so also involves two-way
  mixing.}. The downward motion near the poles can be easily seen from Equation
\ref{eq:zonal_momentum} in the steady case; since $\overline{v}^*$ must become
small near the poles (by conservation of mass), and
$\partial\overline{u}/\partial z > 0$ in the polar vortex, if
$\mathbf{\nabla\cdot F} < 0$, then $\overline{w}^*<0$. It is observed that this
circulation is strongest in the winter hemisphere due to the fact that more
planetary waves can propagate and break in the winter westerly flow than the
summer easterly flow (due to the Charney-Drazin criterion). Furthermore, during
periods of enhanced wave breaking the residual circulation accelerates and there
is more decent and adiabatic heating at high latitudes. This is important in the
physical understanding of sudden stratospheric warming events, described in
Section \ref{sec:strat-sudd-warm}.


\subsubsection{Gravity waves}

Gravity waves are another type of atmospheric wave important in the dynamics of
the polar stratosphere. These waves owe their existence to buoyancy restoring
forces and can be generated by a number of processes such as air flow over
topography (orographic gravity waves), convection or frontogenesis
(non-orographic gravity waves). As with planetary waves, the differences in the
land masses of the two hemispheres leads to orographic gravity wave activity
being much greater in the NH. These waves make a net easterly contribution to
the winter zonal flow \citep[e.g.,][]{Seviour2012}, and so act to enhance the
residual circulation. Their typical length scales are much shorter than can be
resolved in general circulation models or reanalyses, and so they are usually
perameterised, appearing as the term $\overline{X}$ in the zonal momentum
equation (Equation \ref{eq:zonal_momentum}).

\bigskip Together, the Charney-Drazin criterion and the effects of planetary and
gravity wave driving on the zonal flow can expain almost all hemispheric
differences seen in Figures \ref{fig:zmzw_zmT_clim} and \ref{fig:zmzw_NH_SH}:
Greater topography results in more planetary and gravity wave generation in the
NH, both of which cause a net deceleration of the westerly polar vortex, thereby
causing the NH vortex to be weaker than the SH. This also explains why the NH
vortex is warmer than the SH, as the greater NH wave activity induces a stronger
residual circulation with enhanced descent and adiabatic warming at high
latitudes. Additionally, the strength of the SH vortex is such that it prohibits
the vertical propagation of planetary waves from the troposphere throughout much
of the winter, meaning that the SH vortex is less variable than the NH. Both
hemispheres show very little variability in the summer easterly flow because
planetary wave propagation is prohibited in this regime.


\subsection{Sudden stratospheric warmings}
\label{sec:strat-sudd-warm}
%footnote on name
First observed by \citet{Scherhag1952} in radiosonde measurements over Berlin,
the extreme events visible in Figure \ref{fig:zmzw_NH_SH} whereby the winter
circulation temporarily becomes easterly\footnote{For a discussion of more
  precise definitions of SSWs, see Section \ref{sec:moments-introduction}.} are
known as sudden stratospheric warmings\footnote{Following \citet{Butler2014a} it
  is suggested that the term ``sudden stratospheric warming'' is preferrable to
  the common alternative ``stratospheric sudden warming''. This is because there
  are other varieties of stratospheric warming (such as final warmings or
  Canadian warmings), but not other varieties of atmospheric sudden warming.}
(SSWs). These events occur approximately 5-7 times per decade in the NH, but
only one such event has been observed in the $\sim 60$ year observational record
in the SH (in 2002). They are called ``warmings'' because associated with the
circulation reversal is a dramatic increase in temperature; as much as 50~K in
the space of a few days in the midstratosphere.

Initially these events were thought to result from either solar storms or
baroclinic instability of the stratospheric polar vortex. However,
\citet{Matsuno1970, Matsuno1971} proposed a model of SSWs which relies on the
influence of tropospherically forced planetary waves. This model (or
modifications thereof) remains the most widely accepted dynamical view of SSWs
at present. The mechanism proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item A packet of enhanced planetary wave activity enters the stratosphere where
  it reaches a critical surface and breaks. This decelerates the zonal flow over
  a broader critical layer, and if strong enough causes it to reverse.
\item Hence a new, lower critical surface is formed (where $\overline{u}=0$),
  and wave breaking occurs at this level. The process continues as the critical
  layer descends to the lower stratosphere. 
\item At the same time, wave breaking induces an enhanced residual circulation
  with greater descent and adiabatic warming at high latitudes. If strong
  enough, this can act to reverse the meridional temperature gradient, further
  enhancing the easterly flow by thermal wind balance. 
\item When the critical surface is close to the tropopause, planetary wave
  activity is essentially prohibited from entering the polar
  stratosphere. Radiative cooling to space then acts to cool the polar
  stratosphere and the vortex reforms over a period of approximately 2-4 weeks.
\end{enumerate}

This mechanism takes place in an essentially zonal-mean framework. However, it
has been observed that SSWs generally occur as either a split or displacement of
the vortex, mostly depending (though not exlusively; see Section
\ref{sec:moments-introduction}, \citep{Waugh1997}) on whether wave-2 or wave-1
activity is dominant. An example of each of these events is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:charlton_polvani_ssw}. \citet{Charlton2007a} and \citet{Matthewman2009}
studied the dynamics of these two types of events in reanalysis data and noted
some differences. Most significantly, split vortex events where observed to
occur near-barotropically, with two smaller vortices centred over Canada and
Siberia throughout the depth of the stratosphere. On the other hand, displaced
vortex events were observed to be more baroclinic, starting first in the upper
stratosphere with a vortex centred over Canada, the centre of which rotates
westward with height and is centred over Siberia in the lower stratosphere.


\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter-intro/charlton_polvani_SSW.png}
 \caption[Examples of a split and displaced vortex event from
 \citet{Charlton2007a}]{Polar stereographic plot of geopotential height

   warming that occurred in February 1979. Figure from \citet{Charlton2007}.}
 \label{fig:charlton_polvani_ssw}
\end{figure}

This different behaviour of split and displaced vortex events is not accounted
for by the \citet{Matsuno1970, Matsuno1971} model above, and so may suggest that
other mechanisms are important in the generation of SSWs. For instance,
\citet{ONeill1988} and \citet{Scott2006} have suggested that SSWs can be
generated by a cyclone-anticyclone interaction between the Aleutian high and the
polar vortex. These studies showed that a smaller anticyclone can act to
significantly distort the polar vortex, although such interactions are greatest
for circulation ratios higher than are typically found in the polar
stratosphere. Other studies have suggested that SSWs can arise through the
resonant excitation of normal modes of the stratosphere by planetary waves
\citep{Tung1979, Plumb1981, Smith1989}. \citet{Esler2005} and \citet{Esler2006}
suggested that a relevant mode in the case of split vortex events is the
barotropic mode of the atmosphere, which may explain the more barotropic nature
of split vortex events.

Further weight may be given to these mechanisms which do not rely on strong
tropospheric forcing by the ocurrence of the 2002 SH SSW, since this forcing is
much weaker in the SH (several studies of the dynamics of this event can be
found in the March 2005 special issue of \emph{Journal of Atmospheric
  Sciences}). Indeed, \citet{Esler2006} provided evidence that this event may
have been influenced by resonant excitation of the barotropic mode. It should
also be noted that other studies have suggested that SSWs can occur even in the
case of no tropospheric stationary forcing \citep{Kushner2005}.

Overall, while significant advances in understanding the dynamics of SSWs have
been made, several uncertainties remain. While tropospherically-driven wave
activity is certainly an important factor, the roles (if any) of
cyclone-anticyclone interactions or resonance are less certain. Moreover, it is
not clear whether different mechanisms may be more or less important in driving
split and displaced vortex events.


\section{Polar stratospheric ozone depletion}

The Antarctic ozone hole is a large region of severely depleted ozone
concentrations in the lower-mid stratosphere which occurs during the austral
spring. During its formation ozone may be completely lost at some altitudes. A
similar, but much smaller depletion is observed in the NH
\citep[e.g.,][]{Manney1996}. Following its discovery by \citet{Farman1985}, a
chemical and dynamical theory of the ozone hole was rapidly developed which
largely attributes this rapid ozone depletion to the presence of anthropogenic
chlorofuorocarbon (CFC) compounds \citep{McElroy1986,Solomon1986}. This theory
is summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item The strong zonal winds of the stratospheric polar vortex act to confine
  air over the polar regions, with little mixing with midlatitudes
  \citep{Schoeberl1991}. This results in a region of very cold temperatures
  which allow the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs; these require
  temperatures below approximately 195~K to form \citep{Newman2010}).
\item Hetrogeneous chemical rections can take place on the surface of PSCs which
  act to convert `reservior' chlorine species such as \ce{ClONO2} and \ce{HCl}
  into forms that can accelerate ozone depletion, for instance
  \citep{Solomon1986}
  \begin{equation*}
    \ce{ClONO2 + HCl ->[\ce{PSC}] Cl2 + HNO3}
  \end{equation}
\item As sunlight returns to the vortex region in spring, this \ce{Cl2} is
  rapidly photolysed and reacts with oxygen to form \ce{ClO}. This can then
  catalytically destroy ozone through a reaction sequence such as the following
  suggested by \citep{Molina1987}:
  \begin{align*}
    \cee{ClO + ClO &->[\ce{M}] ClOOCl \\
         ClOOCl + $h\nu$ &-> ClOO + Cl \\
         ClOO &->[\ce{M}] Cl + O2 \\
         2(Cl + O3 &-> ClO + O2) \\
         $\mathrm{Net:~}$ 2O3 &-> 3O2} 
  \end{align}
  where $\nu$ is the frequency of light, $h$ is Planck's constant, and M a third
  body. Several other reaction sequences are also possible, for instance
  involving Bromine species. 

\item A further effect of PSCs is that their particles fall out of the
  stratosphere and thereby remove nitrogen compounds
  (\ce{NO$_x$}) from the polar lower stratosphere \citep{Toon1986}. This has the
  effect of further enhancing ozone depletion because these compounds can react
  with \ce{ClO} to form revervior compounds. For instance through the reaction:
  \begin{equation*}
    \ce{Cl + NO2 ->[\ce{M}] ClONO2}
  \end{equation}

\item After some time, radiative heating of the stratosphere is sufficient to
  prevent the formation on PSCs, so ozone depletion halts. This heating is
  further accelerated by the increased wave breaking in the polar stratosphere
  which can take place as the vortex weakens (due to the Charney-Drazin
  criterion) and thereby induce an enhanced residual circulation. Following the
  final breakdown of the vortex and transition to easterlies (final warming),
  the ozone-depleted air is mixed to lower latitudes.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter-intro/2002_SSW.png}
 \caption[]{Comparison of the (middle) first split ozone hole on record (2002)
   and (left) the Antarctic ozone hole at the same time one year earlier (2001)
   and (right) one year later (2003). The hole is dark blue and magenta. In
   2001, the ozone layer thinning over Antarctica reached
   $26.5 \times 10^6~\mathrm{km^2}$ , larger than the size of the entire North
   American continent. Due to higher Antarctic winter temperatures, the 2002
   ``hole'' seems to be about 40\% smaller. In 2003, Antarctic winter
   temperatures returned to normal and the ozone hole returned to its usual
   state. Figure from \citet{Shepherd2005}.}
 \label{fig:2002_SSW}
\end{figure}

Importantly, the stratospheric dynamics described in Section
\ref{sec:dynam-polar-strat}, play an imporant role in ozone depletion. As
discussed in Section \ref{sec:planetary-waves}, wave breaking in the
stratosphere acts to drive a residual circulation, with descent and adiabatic
warming over the pole. Enhanced descent and warming over the pole acts to
inhibit the formation of PSCs which are necessary for the heterogeneous chemical
reactions which cause ozone depletion. 

It is this greater wave activity in the NH then that explains why ozone
depletion is much greater in the SH. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in
interannual variability in wave driving (as measured by
$\mathbf{\nabla\cdot F}$) explains most of the interannual variability of ozone
depletion through this mechanism \citep{Salby2012}. In the extreme event of
SSWs, the ozone hole can be severely disrupted. This can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:2002_SSW}, where a clear split of the ozone hole is visible during the
2002 SH SSW, which contrasts with the more zonally symmetric distributions seen
at the same times in 2001 and 2003. The magnitude of the 2002 ozone hole can
also be seen to be reduced; a result of an enhanced residual circulation causing
warmer stratospheric temperatures. The importance of this link between dynamics
and chemistry for predicting interannual variability in ozone depletion is
discussed further in Sections \ref{sec:ozone-depletion} and
\ref{sec:seas-discussion}.

\section{Annular modes}

Before discussing the influence of the stratosphere on the troposphere, it is
necessary to introduce the concept of the annular modes which are often analysed
in studies of stratosphere-troposphere coupling. The northern and southern
annular modes (NAM and SAM) are the leading modes of large-scale variability in
the two hemispheres. They are commonly defined to be the leading empirical
orthogonal function (EOF) of extratropical geopotential height calculated at
each pressure surface \citep{Baldwin1999, Thompson2000a}, with an index of the
respective principal component. \citet{Baldwin2009} introduced an alternative
using zonal-mean geopotential height, which is therefore less computationally
expensive to calculate. The annular modes at the surface are also often
calculated from mean sea-level pressure \citep[e.g.,][]{Gong1999}, where they
may also be referred to as the Arctic and Antarctic oscillation.

Figure \ref{fig:annular_modes} shows linear regressions of zonal-mean
geostrophic winds and lower tropospheric geopotential height on the NAM and SAM
indices as defined by \citet{Thompson2000a}. It can be seen that the
near-surface NAM structure is more zonally assymmetric than the SAM, with
centres of action located over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 


The Atlantic centre of action resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
pattern, and the surface NAM and NAO have been observed to be highly correlated
\citep{Ambaum2001}.
