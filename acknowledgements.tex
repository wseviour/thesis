  Foremost thanks must go to my supervisor, Lesley Gray, who gave me space to
  explore my own ideas and invaluable advice when I (often) reached a
  dead-end. I am also indebted to my CASE supervisor at the Met Office, Steven
  Hardiman, who first introduced me to atmospheric science during a summer
  placement in 2010, and continued to be an excellent guide through my DPhil.

  This work has benefited greatly from many stimulating discussions with members
  of the AOPP Stratosphere and Climate Group; particularly Dann Mitchell, James
  Anstey, Scott Osprey and Peter Watson. I have also been lucky to have a second
  home at the Met Office, and always came away from my meetings with Neal
  Butchart and Adam Scaife full of ideas.

  My at time AOPP has been hugely enjoyable, and I've never had far to go to
  talk about science or to escape from it. I have enjoyed countless coffee and
  lunch breaks talking about the ups and downs of DPhil life with Adam, Ben,
  Liam and Tris.

  Finally, thanks to all my friends for providing much-needed distractions from
  my work. Thanks to Meg, Adam, Eloise, and Maddie, and thanks to my parents for
  always encouraging me in my latest endeavour.
